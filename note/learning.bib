     abstract = {After a brief motivating discussion of approaches to significance tests in Section 1, the concept of expected significance level (ESL) is defined and its basic properties are presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the relationship between ESL and the familiar criterion of power. While a complete description of power for each size ? is more informative than ESL, it is argued that ESL is often a reasonable compromise between high ideals and practicability. Section 4 gives two estimation methods for Monte Carlo simulation of ESL and shows how to estimate variances and covariances for the second of these methods. The first method leads to the familiar Wilcoxon two-sample statistic which is clearly a sample analogue of ESL. The second and more apposite method leads to a modification of the Wilcoxon statistic.},

We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the "Asimov data set", which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as fluctuations about this expectation.},

   abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6? to 7.5? faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5? and 44? faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}
